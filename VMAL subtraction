# These are a collection of VMAL labs (vertical microprocessor assembly language)
# it's an assembly language for directly programming a CPU (or at least a simulation)

# Task 1: Subtraction
# Your goal for this task is to implement subtraction
# The A and B registers will be initialized with some value
# You must set the C register equal to A - B

# Note that these initial values are just an example.
# Your code should work regardless of what A and B are
# initialized to.
A: 8; # Initialize the A register to 8
B: 5; # Initialize the B register to 5
C: 0; # Initialize the C register to 0 - DO NOT CHANGE

# Goal:
#
#   C = A - B
# This code currently does C = A + B
# Remove this code before starting
# Start your code here

#OPCODE 12, x = NOT (Y), c = not B

NOT C, B;
ADD C, 6;
#OPCODE 9, x = x + y, c = C + A
ADD C, A;
