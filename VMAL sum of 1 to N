# Task 3: Sum of 1 to N
# Your goal for this task is to compute the sum of the first
# N integers.
# The A register will be initialized to the value of N
# The B register should hold the resulting value

# Note that this initial value for A is just an example.
# Your code should work for any (reasonably small) value
# of A
A: 5; # Initialize the A register to 5
B: 0; # Initialize the B register to 0 - DO NOT CHANGE

# Goal:
#
#   B = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + A
#
# If A = 1, then B = 1
# If A = 2, then B = 1 + 2 = 3
# If A = 3, then B = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
# etc.

# Looping in VMAL:
# If you want to perform a loop in VMAL, you will need to
# do something like:
#
#   LBL START_LOOP_1;
#   // Some stuff
#   GO START_LOOP_1;
#   LBL END_LOOP_1;
#
# Where in the "Some stuff" you need to have some way to
# jump to END_LOOP_1 in order to exit the loop. You might
# want to use some sort of if statement (like you learned
# in Task 2) in order to conditionally break out of the
# loop.

# Note: if you want to use BIN or BIZ, you must first 
# do the SF operation to set the N and Z flags.

# Start your code here
