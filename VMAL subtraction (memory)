# Task 1: Subtraction
# Your goal for this task is to implement subtraction
# Two variables X and Y are stored in the main memory
# The location of X is 1024
# The location of Y is 1025
# The location of Z is 1026
# You must set the value of Z to X - Y

A: 1024; # Initialize the A register to 1024 (location of X)
B: 1025; # Initialize the B register to 1025 (location of Y)
C: 1026; # Initialize the C register to 1026 (location of Z)

[1024]: 89; # Initialize the value of X to 8
[1025]: 54; # Initialize the value of Y to 5

# Goal:
#
#   Z = X - Y


# Start your code here

# grab the value of X(8) and store it in registry D
# grab the value of Y(5) and store it in registry E
# store the value of Z(3) and store it in registry F

#this is the get data portion
SA A;
RD; 	#data now stored in MBR
RB A;	#data now stored in A

SA B;
RD;	#data now stored in MBR
RB B;	#data now stored in B

#this is the subtraction portion.
MV D, A;
NOT E, B;
ADD E, 6;
ADD D, E;
#correct value is now in registry D

#write data to main memory
